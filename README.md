# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System

> A machine learning dashboard for predicting the probability of loan default, built with Streamlit and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant losses when borrowers fail to repay loans. This project builds a predictive system that classifies applicants into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** default risk categories based on their demographic and financial profiles — enabling faster, data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 🔑 Key Sub-Features

1. **Custom Data Preprocessing Pipeline** — Automated outlier capping (99th percentile), ordinal encoding for education levels, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and binary encoding for gender/defaults. All steps are modularised in `preprocessing.py`.
2. **Real-Time Inference via Streamlit Dashboard** — Users input applicant details through a form and get instant default probability predictions with risk classification (Low/Medium/High). The app also displays the top 5 factors influencing each prediction.
3. **Multi-Model Comparison Dashboard** — Side-by-side accuracy bar charts, overlaid ROC curves, and a consolidated metrics table (Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC) to compare all three models in one view.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

| Model | Description | Accuracy | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Linear baseline model using sigmoid function | 85.25% | 0.7389 | 0.9523 |
| Decision Tree | Non-linear tree-based model with depth control | 88.03% | 0.7714 | 0.9627 |
| **XGBoost** ⭐ | **Gradient boosted ensemble — best performer** | **91.27%** | **0.8239** | **0.9763** |

All models handle class imbalance (78% No Default vs 22% Default) using `class_weight='balanced'` or `scale_pos_weight`.
